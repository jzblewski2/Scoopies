<h3>Peter Custard</h3>
<p id="owner">Peter has been the owner since Scoopie's first opened in 2003.

<h3>Roseanne Scoopie</h3>
<p id="owner">Roseanne is Peter's daugther and has been an owner since she turned 18. 
    When she was just four years old she told her father her dream was to have her very own frozen custard shoppe. 
    With that Scoopie's Custard was created.</p>
